# ZipZap: MagiReco NA Private Server

**Please be mindful when sharing.** We donâ€™t want Aniplex shutting down NA yet again, so please keep this off of
mainstream social media sites. In fact, when you do share, please add a reminder to keep it off social media.

You need to have a computer to run the server on, and a device with MagiReco to connect to it (both emulator and real 
physical device work).

To update to a new release: download the release, unzip it without overwriting the old one, then copy your data/user
folder from the old one to the new one. If you don't want to install a new cert to your phone every time you update, also 
copy the (windows/nginx_windows/)nginx/conf/cert from the old to the new.

### On the computer: installation and running

For Windows, please download a release rather than the source code.

The first time before you run the server on Windows, you need to do some setup:
1. Run setupServer.bat.
2. A cmd window should pop up. Wait until it closes by itself.
3. Check to make sure there is a file named ca.crt in the ZipZap folder.

You only need to do this once. (Although if you ever run setupServer.bat again, you'll have to repeat step 3.)

Then, to actually run the server, run startServer.bat. A cmd window should pop up without immediately closing; don't 
close it until you want to stop the server. That's all.

#### Alternate installation method

An alternate method is available that will run ZipZap in its own self-contained Linux virtual machine. This method can be 
used on Windows, Mac and Linux. For this, you will need to download the source code rather than the release.

You will need to download and install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) (**be sure and also download and install
the VirtualBox Guest Additions**) as well as [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/). Both of these apps are completely
free for personal/non-commercial use. Once these are installed, simply open a terminal in the server window and type 
`vagrant up`. This will automatically configure ZipZap and run it.

In some rare cases, Vagrant will ask you for which network interface you would like to use as the bridge interface.
Usually the topmost choice is the right one, but in some rare instances you will have to choose one of the other
options. If the option you choose didn't work, run `vagrant destroy` followed by `vagrant up` and try a different
choice.

Once the configuration process is complete, the script will display the VM's IP address. On your device or emulator,
set the DNS server to that IP address, then open a web browser and go to `https://magica-us.com`. You should see a page
asking you to install the custom SSL certificate. Follow the instructions to do this. Now you should be able to run
Magia Record and connect to your private server!

To start up the private server VM, run `vagrant up`; and to shut it down run `vagrant halt`.

### On your phone/tablet/emulator: connecting to the private server

0. Run the server on your computer, and keep it running.
1. Find the IP address of the computer you're running the server on. I've only tested this with a local IP address (ones
that start with 192.168) but external IP addresses should work.
2. Change your DNS settings to point to your IP address. On iOS you can do this by editing the network settings as you
would with a proxy (just make sure to edit DNS, not proxy, settings), but on Android emulator I've had to use a 
different app. The one I use is just called DNS Changer, and its icon is a blue circle with DNS in it.
3. If this is the first time you're playing, go to https://android.magica-us.com. (The https is important.) Download the
link labled ca.crt and install it using the information in the links provided.

### But my network is really, really, really weird and DNS messes it up!

2. Edit the config.json in the top level folder of the server so that the "useDNS" key is set to `false`
3. Use a hosts editor on your phone/emulator to point android.magica-us.com or ios.magica-us.com (based on your OS) to
the server computer's local IP address.
4. Everything else is normal. If this is the first time you're playing, go to https://android.magica-us.com and install
the cert.

Note that this does not redirect other tracking websites. I honestly don't think it should be a huge problem for now,
but sooner or later I'll have to stop being lazy and add them in this README oof

### A note about Android 7 (Nougat) and above

Due to a change that Google made starting in Android 7 (Nougat)
[user-installed CA certificates are no longer trusted by apps](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2016/07/changes-to-trusted-certificate.html).
In order to play on devices and/or emulators running Android 7 and above, you'll either have to root, or play using the
APK linked on https://android.magica-us.com. (The APK only appears in Windows releases, unfortunately.)

### What's next?
I coded very fast, and very not well, because I wanted to get as many features out before the 30th. Code quality is still
important to me, though, and I really don't want to get anything done outside of the basics before improving it enough
that maintenance will not be horrendous. But before the 30th, my priority is to get all the basic functions implemented
so that we won't have to rely on hitting the real server to figure out what it does for some important thing like 
battles.

The features are in order of the most overlap with the knowledge I have currently, to the least, because when I 
implement a new feature I don't know much about at least half of the time is spent researching how it fits in with all 
the user's data.

- implement missions
- implement announcements
- add unit tests
- refactor for online server
    - compress user data, so it's not huge jsons with info we don't need
- add support for events
- add support for multiple users
- add support for finding other users, following and using supports
